# ecx2-openapi-doc
An OpenAPI (or Swagger) document to describe the eCX API.

This repository holds an OpenAPI document that describes the APWG eCrime eXchange (eCX) API.
Although there are other documents describing the API operations and fields, there have been requests for a document that could be input into one of the "code generation" tools. This is that document.

## How to use this file

You could download this file and open it with your favourite OpenAPI or Swagger display tool.
One example is to use vscode, install the "Swagger Viewer" extension, and then select "preview swagger" in the command palette.  (We also use the "TODO Tree" extensions, as you will see.)
Another example is to use Postman and display it there.  You may have a favourite tool to use. Lots of options. :)

If you have no favourite tool, visit https://editor.swagger.io and point the editor at the ecx-openapi-doc.yaml file. This site is capable of generating client code for you if various languages.
